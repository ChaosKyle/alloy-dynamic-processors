## Security Model

### Security Principles

Our security model is built on the following principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions for all components
3. **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
4. **Data Minimization**: Collect and retain only necessary data
5. **Transparency**: Security through visibility and monitoring

kind: Role
metadata:
  name: alloy-processor
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["configmaps", "secrets"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

### Network Security

**Network Segmentation:**

- Ingress controllers with TLS termination
- Service mesh integration (Istio/Linkerd) for mTLS
- Firewall rules and security groups

**Traffic Encryption:**
- TLS 1.3 for all external communications
- mTLS for inter-service communication
- End-to-end encryption for telemetry data

kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: alloy-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: alloy
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
